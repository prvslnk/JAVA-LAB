/*  Declare a variable Student which consists of a studentâ€™sname, markfor Programming, mark for Logic and a grade for Lab. A mark is a number (between 0 and100) and a grade is a letter (between A and F). Write a predicate (a boolean method) isStronger, which takes two students and returns true if and only if the first student has done better than the second in the ordering below. 
a.  the Programming mark is most important, 
b.  numerical order of Logic marks is the determining factor when two students have the same Programming mark, 
c.  alphabetical order of Lab grades is the determining factor when two students have the same Programming and Maths marks.
